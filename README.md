# 💡 Creative Unity: My Project

Get ready to explore! I used the knowledge from the Creative Course to independently create this environment from scratch. Here’s a look at the key technical systems and features I implemented:

•	🎨 Shaders / Materials: Dive into custom Shader Graph materials and different Shaders utilized across the environment for enhanced realism.

•	💡 Lighting: The scene employs a high-performance Baked/Mixed lighting pipeline, with reflections visible on various objects.

•	🏃 Animation: Observe the seamless Animation system integration for the animals within the scene.

• 💨 VFX & Post-processing: Explore custom VFX setups and their URP lighting integration. The scene utilizes a Global Box Volume for overall cinematic effects, complemented by individual post-processing setups created specifically for the animal objects.	

• 🔊 Audio: Listen closely to the spatial audio cues, featuring the Dynamic Rolloff effect for realistic distance-based volume control.

•	📸 Cameras & UI: Master the camera system, where the view is controlled by the Mouse and is integrated with the helicopter's movement. You can instantly toggle between First Person and Third Person views using the 'C' key. Interact with the functional UI to manage scene elements like the helicopter engine sound, fireworks, and lights.

•	🏞️ Prototyping & Environment: Explore the foundational construction, including the creation of the custom terrain and the procedural placement of trees.
